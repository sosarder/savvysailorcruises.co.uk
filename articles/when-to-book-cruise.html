            <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Book 1&ndash;2 months before departure for best value. Avoid 6&ndash;9 months out like the plague.

        <h2>The Sweet Spot: 1&ndash;2 Months Before Departure</h2>

        <p>Analysing 608,236 cruise records across 23 cruise lines reveals a clear pattern: <strong>last-minute bookings deliver 20&ndash;47% savings</strong> compared to booking 6&ndash;9 months in advance. The conventional wisdom of &ldquo;book early for best price&rdquo; is demonstrably false for European cruises.</p>

        <div class="article-box article-box-highlight">
            <strong>Key Finding:</strong> MSC Cruises drop from &pound;1,115 (6&ndash;9 months) to &pound;606 (1&ndash;2 months) &mdash; a 46% discount for waiting. P&amp;O Cruises follow similar patterns: &pound;969 (6&ndash;9 months) to &pound;852 (0&ndash;1 month last-minute) &mdash; 12% savings.

        <h2>Why This Happens</h2>

        <p><strong>Inventory management.</strong> Cruise lines release initial inventory at moderate prices (9&ndash;12 months out), then inflate prices for the &ldquo;book early&rdquo; crowd (6&ndash;9 months). As departure approaches and cabins remain unsold, prices drop aggressively to fill the ship. An empty cabin generates zero revenue; &pound;600 generates &pound;600.</p>

        <div class="article-graph">
            <img src="../images/article2_graph_percentage_corrected.png" alt="Line chart showing percentage price change versus early booking baseline across cruise lines. Peak inflation occurs at 6-9 months out, then prices steadily decline.">
            <p>Change vs 9&ndash;12 month baseline. Peak inflation at 6&ndash;9 months, then steady decline.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Booking Strategy</h2>

        <p><strong>For maximum flexibility:</strong> Book 9&ndash;12 months out when you need specific cabin locations, accessible cabins, or fixed dates around work commitments. Accept paying the premium for certainty.</p>

        <p><strong>For maximum value:</strong> Wait until 1&ndash;2 months before departure. Accept limited cabin choice and potential date flexibility. Monitor prices weekly in your target window.</p>

        <p><strong>Never book 6&ndash;9 months out.</strong> You miss both the early-bird inventory pricing and the last-minute discounting. This window delivers maximum cost with minimum benefit.</p>
